TODO

- Convert starfishjs to be more platform-agnostic library-like
  x Convert as much of the code as possible to work directly with image
    buffer data, not canvas contexts. Don't require the image buffer
    data to have actually come from an Image object.
    . References that should be gone when we're done: ctx,
      this.layerCanvas, this.backing,  drawSomeToCanvas,
      drawToCanvas
      renderAt: layerCanvas, layerContext
    . Be sure to pass ImageData.data.buffer (along with offset and
    length) to node Buffer constructor
- build a node CLI image generator, using "node-png"?
- implement a wallpaper-setting feature (use npm's "wallpaper"?)
- give finer control over layers, etc.
- Make cloud-layer generator infinitely fine-grained (seeded/replayable
  PRNG?)
- Make various constants in starfish.js more configurable (via args to
  Instance construction? Directly settable in Starfish object?)

/ implement a wallpaper-setting feature (use npm's "wallpaper"?)
    . Can't set the wallpaper to "tiled"
    . Doesn't work when the new wallpaper has the same name(/path?) as
      the previous one.
- make implementation more nodejs Stream-like, perhaps?
- retina support in web version (images at higher dpi)
- give finer control over layers, etc., and reproducible config
- Make cloud-layer generator infinitely fine-grained (seeded/replayable
  PRNG?)
- Make various constants in starfish.js more configurable (via args to
  Instance construction? Directly settable in Starfish object?)

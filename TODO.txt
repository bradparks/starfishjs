TODO

- Convert starfishjs to be more platform-agnostic library-like
- build a node CLI image generator, using "node-png"?
- implement a wallpaper-setting feature (use npm's "wallpaper"?)
- give finer control over layers, etc.
- Make cloud-layer generator infinitely fine-grained (seeded/replayable
  PRNG?)
- Make various constants in starfish.js more configurable (via args to
  Instance construction? Directly settable in Starfish object?)

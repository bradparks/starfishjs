TODO

- implement option parsing in cli.js
- implement a wallpaper-setting feature (use npm's "wallpaper"?)
- give finer control over layers, etc., and reproducible config
- Make cloud-layer generator infinitely fine-grained (seeded/replayable
  PRNG?)
- Make various constants in starfish.js more configurable (via args to
  Instance construction? Directly settable in Starfish object?)

           (From Mars's original starfish code comments:)
           I once attempted to make the coswave shift its scale over
           time, much like the spinflake generator does with its twist.
           I wasn't particularly succesful.  But I did happen upon a
           *beautifully* bizarre twist to the generator which is really
           strange but not terribly useful. So I fire it once in every 64
           generations or so, which is just infrequent enough that the
           viewer really goes "what the hell is THAT" when they see it.

           It's chaotic moir√©ness, sorta - the wavescale increases by
           the exponent of the distance. At some point, the wavescale
           becomes less than one pixel, and then chaos begins to happen.
           Odd eddies show up, turbulences become visible, and a bit of
           static shines through here and there. It's quite beautiful in an
           abstract sort of way.

           factor, which serves as a multiplier. Currently wave scale
           modifications can range from half length to double length. It
           would be fun to widen this sometime and see what happened.

           The squish angle determines the "direction" of the squish
           effect. The strength of the squish is determined by the sine
           of the difference between the angle between the current point
